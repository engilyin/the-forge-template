## What Is This?

The **FORGE Template** is a production-quality project scaffold for building software using **GitHub Copilot CLI** as an AI-assisted development partner. It implements the FORGE methodology — a structured, specification-driven approach to AI-assisted software development that targets Dan Shapiro's Level 4 (Engineered Vibe) and Level 5 (Dark Factory) coding maturity.

Instead of "describe what you want and hope for the best," FORGE gives you:

| Without FORGE | With FORGE |
|--------------|-----------|
| Vague prompts → inconsistent code | Structured specs → precise, traceable code |
| Single AI agent doing everything | Specialized agent roles (BA, Architect, Dev, QA) |
| No process → no reproducibility | Full SDLC loop → repeatable, auditable process |
| Manual, one-at-a-time generation | Dark Factory: parallel fleet agents via git worktrees |
| Code disconnected from requirements | Every line traces back to a spec and a story |

---

## Key Concepts

### 🔥 FORGE Framework (Frame → Obstruct → Reconstruct → Generate → Edit)

FORGE is a five-phase AI-assisted SDLC methodology:

| Phase | What Happens | Output |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Frame** | Interview stakeholders. Define vision, goals, scope, actors. | `spec/business/frame.md` |
| **Obstruct** | Stress-test the frame. Find risks, gaps, assumptions, unknowns. | `spec/business/obstruct-report.md` |
| **Reconstruct** | Resolve obstructions. Design architecture. Write full specs. | Full `spec/business/` + `spec/technical/` |
| **Generate** | Build code, tests, infrastructure. Story by story. | Code in `solution/` |
| **Edit** | Review, validate, refactor, polish. Go/No-Go decision. | Validated release candidate |

FORGE ensures AI agents are always working from precise, reviewed specifications — not improvising from vague prompts.

### 🎯 5 Levels of Vibe Coding (Dan Shapiro)

Dan Shapiro's maturity model for AI-assisted development:

| Level | Name | Description | Human Role |
|-------|------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Pure Vibe** | Casual prompts, no structure | Full developer |
| 2 | **Directed Vibe** | Rough requirements, some guidance | Active developer |
| 3 | **Structured Vibe** | Templates and patterns | Technical lead |
| 4 | **Engineered Vibe** | Formal specs, multiple agents, SDLC | Reviewer/approver |
| 5 | **Dark Factory** | Fully automated, parallel fleets | Product manager |

**This template targets Level 4-5.** It provides all the scaffolding for Level 4 from day one, with Dark Factory (Level 5) capabilities available when your process matures.

### 🏭 Dark Factory Model (StrongDM)

Inspired by the manufacturing concept of lights-out factories — facilities that run fully automated with no human workers on the floor.

In software, the Dark Factory means:
- **Parallel agent fleets** work simultaneously on multiple stories
- **Git worktrees** isolate each agent's work on its own branch
- **Automated quality gates** validate each story before human review
- **Human checkpoints** occur only at iteration boundaries (before/after each sprint)
- **Autonomous execution** within each iteration

```
Iteration Start (Human approves plan)
    ↓
Dark Factory executes all stories in parallel
    ├── Backend Agent → STORY-001 (worktree: feature/STORY-001)
    ├── Frontend Agent → STORY-002 (worktree: feature/STORY-002)
    ├── Mobile Agent → STORY-003 (worktree: feature/STORY-003)
    └── DevOps Agent → STORY-004 (worktree: feature/STORY-004)
    ↓
Quality gates pass → Stories complete
    ↓
Iteration End (Human reviews report, decides Go/No-Go)
```

→ Full guide: [`.github/instructions/dark-factory.md`](.github/instructions/dark-factory.md)

---

### 📋 OpenSpec.dev Format

All specifications in this template use **OpenSpec** — a structured, AI-readable specification format that provides:
- YAML front matter for machine-readable metadata
- Standardized sections: overview, actors, user stories, acceptance criteria, NFRs
- Full traceability from business goal to code to test
- Version control friendly (plain markdown, diffs cleanly)

Every spec follows: `spec_id` → `title` → `status` → structured sections.

→ Full guide: [`.github/instructions/openspec-format.md`](.github/instructions/openspec-format.md)

---

### 🌿 Git Worktrees for Parallel Agents

Git worktrees allow multiple working directories from the same repository simultaneously — each on a different branch. This is how the Dark Factory runs parallel agents:

```bash
# Create isolated environments for parallel agent work
git worktree add worktrees/story-001 -b feature/STORY-001-auth
git worktree add worktrees/story-002 -b feature/STORY-002-profile-ui
git worktree add worktrees/story-003 -b feature/STORY-003-ios-screens

# Agents work simultaneously in their respective worktrees
# No branch switching, no stashing, no conflicts

# Clean up after merging
git worktree prune
```

Requires Git 2.5+ (included in all modern Git installations).

## Quick Start

### Mode 1: Greenfield (New Project)

**Start a brand-new project from scratch.**

1. **Open this repository in VS Code** with GitHub Copilot extension enabled

2. **Run the Greenfield Initializer:**
   ```
   @workspace Run .github/prompts/project/greenfield-init.prompt.md
   ```

3. **Answer Copilot's questions** about your project (name, domain, goals, stack preferences)

4. **Follow the FORGE flow** — Copilot will guide you through:
   - Frame → `spec/business/frame.md` produced
   - Obstruct → risks and gaps identified
   - Reconstruct → full specs in `spec/business/` and `spec/technical/`

5. **Create your backlog:**
   ```
   @workspace Run .github/prompts/backlog/story-breakdown.prompt.md
   @workspace Run .github/prompts/backlog/backlog-grooming.prompt.md
   @workspace Run .github/prompts/backlog/iteration-planning.prompt.md
   ```

6. **Generate your first iteration:**
   - Interactive mode (one story at a time):
     ```
     @workspace Run .github/prompts/forge/04-generate.prompt.md
     ```
   - Dark Factory mode (all stories in parallel):
     ```
     @workspace Run .github/prompts/dark-factory/run-iteration.prompt.md
     ```

7. **Review and release:**
   ```
   @workspace Run .github/prompts/dark-factory/assess-iteration.prompt.md
   ```

---

### Mode 2: Brownfield (Existing Codebase)

**Bring an existing project into the FORGE workflow.**

1. **Copy your existing code into `solution/`:**
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/your/existing/project/* solution/
   # or
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-project solution/
   ```

2. **Run the Brownfield Analysis:**
   ```
   @workspace Run .github/prompts/project/brownfield-analysis.prompt.md
   ```
   Copilot will scan your codebase and generate:
   - `spec/technical/architecture.md` — reverse-engineered architecture
   - `spec/technical/api-contracts.md` — documented API surface
   - `spec/technical/data-model.md` — entity discovery
   - `spec/business/brownfield-discovery.md` — full discovery report

3. **Review the generated specs** — Correct any inaccuracies Copilot may have inferred

4. **Run the Obstruct phase** to identify improvement opportunities:
   ```
   @workspace Run .github/prompts/forge/02-obstruct.prompt.md
   ```

5. **Plan your first improvement iteration:**
   ```
   @workspace Run .github/prompts/backlog/story-breakdown.prompt.md
   ```

## SDLC Flow

```
Discovery → Specification → Backlog → Grooming → Iteration Planning → Development → Review/QA → Release
     ↑                                                                                              │
     └──────────────────────────── Next Iteration ────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Stage | Copilot Prompt | Agent Roles | Artifacts |
|-------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Discovery | `project/greenfield-init` or `project/brownfield-analysis` | BA, SA, PM | Discovery notes, initial epics |
| Specification | `forge/01-frame` → `02-obstruct` → `03-reconstruct` | BA, SA, TL | Full spec set |
| Backlog | `backlog/story-breakdown` | BA, SM | `spec/business/backlog.md` |
| Grooming | `backlog/backlog-grooming` | SM, TL, BA | Estimated, Ready backlog |
| Iteration Planning | `backlog/iteration-planning` | SM, PM, TL | Iteration plan + story specs |
| Development | `forge/04-generate` or `dark-factory/run-iteration` | Dev agents | Code in `solution/` |
| Review/QA | `forge/05-edit` | TL, QA | QA report, release candidate |
| Release | (manual + DevOps agent) | DevOps, TL | Deployed release |

Human checkpoints occur after every stage. The user reviews artifacts and decides whether to proceed.

### Invoking an Agent
```
@workspace Read .github/agents/java-backend-developer.md and act as this agent for this session.
```

---

## Technology Stack

This template is designed for (but not limited to):

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Java 21 · Spring Boot 3.x · Spring WebFlux · Spring Cloud |
| Frontend | React 18 · TypeScript · Vite · TanStack Query · Zustand · Tailwind CSS |
| Mobile | Expo SDK · React Native · TypeScript · Expo Router |
| Database | PostgreSQL (R2DBC) · DynamoDB · Redis |
| Cloud | AWS (EKS, RDS, S3, ElastiCache, Route 53, ACM, Secrets Manager) |
| IaC | Terraform 1.6+ · Kustomize · Helm 3 |
| CI/CD | Jenkins (declarative pipelines) · Docker · ECR |
| Orchestration | Kubernetes (EKS) |
| Observability | CloudWatch · X-Ray · Prometheus · Grafana |

You can adapt the stack — the FORGE process works with any technology. Agent files contain the tech-specific knowledge; the SDLC flow is technology-agnostic.

## Dark Factory Mode

Dark Factory is the Level 5 autonomous execution mode. Activate it when:
- Your specs are mature (high-quality, unambiguous)
- Your team has confidence in the spec-to-code pipeline
- You want maximum throughput across a known backlog

### To Activate
```
@workspace Run .github/prompts/dark-factory/run-iteration.prompt.md
```

### What Happens
1. Copilot reads the iteration plan from `spec/iterations/iteration-N/plan.md`
2. Creates a git worktree for each story
3. Assigns each worktree to the appropriate agent role
4. Executes all stories (in parallel where dependencies allow)
5. Runs quality gates after each story (tests, lint, build, security scan)
6. Updates `spec/iterations/iteration-N/status.md` continuously
7. Presents a consolidated report for human review

### Quality Gates (automated)
- ✅ Unit tests: 100% pass
- ✅ Linter: 0 errors
- ✅ Build: successful
- ✅ Security scan: no new critical/high CVEs
- ✅ `terraform validate`: passes (if IaC changed)

→ Full guide: [`.github/instructions/dark-factory.md`](.github/instructions/dark-factory.md)

## Specification Format

All specs follow **OpenSpec** — structured markdown with YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
spec_id: SPEC-001
title: "My Project — Frame Document"
version: "0.1.0"
status: approved
type: business
---

## Overview
## Actors
## User Stories
